The aim of this project was to design an ultrasonic distance sensing circuit that can be used as an aid in parking a car
in a garage. 

The ultrasonic distance sensor provides accurate real-time analog output proportional to the distance to a 
vehicle. The measurement range of the system is 30 cm (centimeter) to 3 m (meter). 

A microprocessor, *Arduino*, is used to sample the output of the analog circuit and communicate with a PC (Personal computer)
through a serial interface and displayed on a GUI (Graphical user interface),which also allows the user to send commands 
to the Arduino
